# Continuous integration with Gitlab.

First, we will create a project in GitLab. For this, we will use the https://gitlab.com/ platform, in order to avoid installing our own GitLab platform locally.

If you don't have an account on GitLab yet, I invite you to create one, then to connect.

Once connected, you will arrive on a page listing all your projects. If you have just created the account, normally this page will be empty.


## Create a Repo
Create a new repository and call it CalculatorLibrary. In order for all integration features to be available, you must set your repo to Public. 

We will use a small existing project to focus only on continuous integration. 

To do this we will add a remote to our repository :

```
git  remote add upstream git@github.com:becodeorg/My_Calculator_CI-CD.git 
``` 

Then we will pull the master branch
```
git pull upstream master
```

You should now have this as a :

```
./calculator/
    >> __init__.py
    >> utils.py
./test/
    >> __init__.py
    >> test_calculator.py
.gitignore
README.md
requirements.txt
```

The file calculator/utils.py contains :
```python

"""
Calculator library containing basic math operations.
"""

def add(first_term, second_term):
    return first_term + second_term

def subtract(first_term, second_term):
    return first_term - second_term
```

The file /test/test_calculator.py contains the unit tests for our calculator.

```python

"""
Unit tests for the calculator library
"""
from calculator import utils


class TestCalculator:

    def test_addition(self):
        assert 4 == utils.add(2, 2)

    def test_subtraction(self):
        assert 2 == utils.subtract(4, 2)

```
The ``__init__.py`` files are empty and the other files you know!

Ok, it's time to pusher the whole thing on gitlab.

```
git push -u origin master
```

You should have all your files on your gitlab repo if everything went well.

## Create a pipeline and test your code

On the Gitlab project home page, click on ``Set Up Ci/Cd.`` 

![](https://mybecode-files-production.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/230a94a3-5059-40e9-868c-f9651eeff30f-tempsnip.png)

This will create a new file in your repo named "gitlab-ci.yml".


```yml

image: python:3.7
stages:
  - build
  - test

cache:
  paths:
    - .cache/pip
    - venv/

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - python --version
    - python3 -m venv venv
    - . venv/bin/activate
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - . venv/bin/activate
    - pytest -v --cov=calculator

```

**Image :** 

```yml
image: python:3.7
```
This is the Docker image on which the instance will be launched. The image can come from the DockerHub or provide own it if necessary.

**Stages :**
Use stages to define stages that contain groups of jobs. stages is defined globally for the pipeline. Use stage in a job to define which stage the job is part of.

The order of the stages items defines the execution order for jobs:

Jobs in the same stage run in parallel.
Jobs in the next stage run after the jobs from the previous stage complete successfully.
For example:

```
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
```

If any job fails, the pipeline is marked as failed and jobs in later stages do not start. Jobs in the current stage are not stopped and continue to run.

If no stages are defined in the ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` file, then build, test and deploy are the default pipeline stages.

If a job does not specify a stage, the job is assigned the test stage.

To make a job start earlier and ignore the stage order, use the needs keyword.


[Gitlab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/)

**Cache :**

```yml
cache:
  paths:
    - .cache/pip
    - venv/
```
Caching is necessary for some tasks to work properly. For example, in our case, we need to be able to cache the ``venv`` folder in order to reactivate it for the next task which is to test the code.

**Build Job**

```yml

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - python --version
    - python3 -m venv venv
    - . venv/bin/activate
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This is a task that is intended to install and configure all the dependencies that are essential for the proper functioning of the code. You can insert bash in the values for the label "script".


**Test Job**

```yml
test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - . venv/bin/activate
    - pytest -v --cov=calculator
```
This is the piece of code that will allow us to test our code. So we activate the python environment ``. venv/bin/activate`` and we launch the tests with pytest

Ok it's time to start testing. Click on "Commit changes" button.


You should be able to do the tasks at hand. Click on the "3jobs" button in the left sidebar.

You should see this after +- 2 minutes :

If you want to know more about what's going on you click on the task number.

From now on, each time you make a push, a code test will be launched automatically. If it fails, then the code will not be pushed, and the developer will have to fix the problem.

## Drill 

It's up to you now. 

1. In the file /calculator/utils.py add two functions:
    - multiply which takes two numbers and returns the product of the multplication
    - divide which takes two numbers and returns the quotient of the division 
2. Create the tests for these two functions in the file test/test_calculator.py
3. Push on gitlab !
4. Watch the jobs run.
