# Continous integration : Icebreaker_api

- Repository: `challenge-icebreaker-api`
- Type of Challenge:  `Consolidation`
- Duration: `4 Hours`
- Deadline: `10/05/2021`
- Deployment strategy :
	- Gitlab
- Team challenge : `solo`

## The Mission
Your mission will be to create an integration pipeline for an API that returns text in json. On the one hand you will have to create some tests with pytest and then create a pipeline that will execute your tests every time a push is made on the repo.

## Mission objectives 

Consolidate your knowledge with unit tests.  
Consolidate your knowledge with Docker.  
Consolidate your knowledge with Git/Gitlab.  


## Must-have features

1. You must use this repo https://gitlab.com/LudovicPatho/icebreaker_api_ci

2. You must use the docker image found on the repo and not a docker image from DockerHub. So you will have to build the image before launching the tests.

3. For unit tests : 

    - You have to do a test on the api endpoint ``/api/ping`` which tests if the answer is indeed a 200 answer. 

    - You have to do a test on the endpoint ``/api`` and check that you receive a text with at least 10 characters. 
    
    - You have to do a test on the endpoint ``api/<integer>`` and check that you receive x sentences. Example ``api/10`` return 10 sentences.
    Test with 5, 10 and 15 sentences.

    - Still on the endpoint ``api/<integer>``, check that it is an integer and not a string. If a string is set instead of an integer, the api returns 
    {"Error" : "Must be an integer"}


## Deliverables
1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. Pimp up the readme file:
	- What, Why, When, How, Who.
	- Pending things to do
	- It must contain a link to the "live" version. The "live" version must contain a link to the source code on GitHub.
3. Publish the link to the "live" version on your startup's Discord's channel.


## A final note of encouragement

Okay! That's a lot of learning! But now you know how to automate your tests and make sure there are less errors in the future!
