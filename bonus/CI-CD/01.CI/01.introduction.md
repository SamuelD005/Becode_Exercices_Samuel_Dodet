# Continuous integration
One of the main concepts of DevOps is continuous integration. Continuous Integration (CI) is an essential component in an agile development environment. It gathers a set of practices aimed at accelerating the development of an application while guaranteeing the quality of the code.

## What is continuous integration? How does it work in practice?   

Continuous integration is a set of practices that consists of automated testing of each code revision before deploying it to production. 

When the developer codes a feature, he also designs the associated test and adds it to his code repository. The integration server will then run all the tests to verify that no regression has been introduced into the source code as a result of this addition. If a problem is identified, the deployment does not take place and the Devs are notified. If no errors are reported, the integration server can deploy the code directly to production.  

## What does continuous integration bring? 

The main contribution of continuous integration is to guarantee quality code in production, and therefore better end-user satisfaction. Indeed, the automation of the tests of all the source code at each addition/modification of functionalities allows to avoid the introduction of regressions in production. Developers can configure the notifications of the integration server and thus be warned on the service of their choice in case of anomalies (webhook, email, etc...), thus saving precious time. 

In reality, not all of the code is tested, because test development takes time. At Padok, we consider that from 80% onwards we guarantee a good test coverage. It is better to have the main features tested than the whole application poorly tested. 

Continuous integration also allows Devs to have a faster feedback on their development. There is no need to wait several weeks to identify and correct errors.

Finally, continuous integration promotes teamwork. Often, several Devs work on separate tasks within the same project. The larger the team, the higher the risk of introducing errors during integration. And if something goes wrong, debugging can be very time consuming. By integrating code revisions on a daily basis, the risk of error is minimized. Conflicts within the team are reduced and Devs are no longer afraid to "break the code" with each deployment.


> ⚠️ Note that continuous delivery should not be confused with continuous deployment, which is the logical continuation of continuous delivery. Both disciplines have the objective of deploying an application to production. The difference lies in the automation of the deployment to production. Continuous delivery stops before production, and putting an application into production remains a manual act (whether with a tool, or automated via a button click, or manually). The production release is then subject to the validation of a human being.


Continuous deployment is the extension of continuous delivery: the deployment is done in an automated way by a pipeline. All the steps of compilation, unit tests and other automated tests must be completed before deployment.

Some continuous integration tools : 

**Jenkins :**  
Jenkins is a free continuous integration software developed in Java. It works in a web container or in standalone mode with its own embedded web server. Being open source, Jenkins federates a large community that regularly proposes new improvements to the service. It is quite easy to install and more than 1000 plugins are available, allowing it to be integrated with most development, testing and deployment tools.

**Travis CI :**
Travis CI is a free continuous integration software published under the MIT license. It allows to compile, test and deploy the source code of developed software, especially in connection with the GitHub source code hosting service. Its configuration is done in YAML. Travis also allows to launch tests in Docker environments.

**GitLab CI :**
GitLab is a free git-based forge software offering wiki functionality, a bug tracking system, continuous integration and continuous delivery.

**Github Action :**
More recently, github has set up an Action ui service that allows to set up a pipeline for a project in continuous integration.

We will focus mainly on Gitlab and Github Action.
