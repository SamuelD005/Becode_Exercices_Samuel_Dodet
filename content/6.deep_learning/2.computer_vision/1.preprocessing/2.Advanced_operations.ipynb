    "Let's dive a bit deeper. \n",
    "In order to have clearer images, ready for further processing, we have to clean them. Indeed, there is some \"recurrent noise\" in some images, the kind of noise that you often have to deal with.\n",
    "It can be noise coming from bad quality scanners or the ones that you find on old paper, and many more...\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix that, openCV has a bunch of methods that are very handy. \n",

    "## Image thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "Another hot topic in image preprocessing is image thresholding, which is basically deciding if a pixel should be white or black to remove the noise.\n",
    "[Here is the official documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html) about it.\n",
    "And [a well made article about it](https://medium.com/spinor/a-straightforward-introduction-to-image-thresholding-using-python-f1c085f02d5e).\n",
    "Take the time to read both, they are super useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice time\n",
    "Now that you start to see how powerful openCV is, let's take a concrete example.\n",
    "You want to detect the most recurrent words in a book. You scan the entire book and you end with pictures like that:\n",
